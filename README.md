      <p>
        Sehat AI is an AI-powered health platform that predicts risks for Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's using clinical ML models. Users input health metrics to receive instant, personalized risk   
        assessments with visual reports. Designed for early detection, it complements (but doesn’t replace) medical advice. All data stays private with client-side processing. Empowering proactive health 
        decisions through AI.

        In the future, Sehat AI aims to expand its predictions to include a broader range of diseases, offering even more 
        personalized health assessments. And also aims to add multilingual report generation feature.
